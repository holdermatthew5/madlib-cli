      - The purpose of the Madlib CLI is to provide a short madlib game.
    Use:
      - To use the Madlib CLI change directory into the madlib_cli folder and run the madlib.py file with python. This can be done with the following code:
        - (from main repo directory.) `cd madlib_cli`
        - `python madlib.py`
      - Once you are prompted to input words simply enter a word matching the description provided.
        - When it says Adjective enter an adjective of your choice.
        - When it says First Name put in a name of your choosing.
      - When you've entered all the words needed the program will take over and paste your words into a Madlib sentence and print it for you to read and enjoy.
